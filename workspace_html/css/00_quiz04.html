                Dave, the Streatham rapper who at just 19 has already guested with US superstar
                Drake, was awarded best contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute
                hip-hop track that criticises Theresa May over lack of NHS funding, military
                involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and more. The track also castigates David
                Cameron over Brexit (“You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing
                line”) and ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective, honest politician.
                One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her handling of the Grenfell
                Tower disaster.
